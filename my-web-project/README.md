## Setting Up a Local Development Environment

1. **Install a Local Server**: 
   - Use software like XAMPP, MAMP, or WAMP to run PHP locally. Download and install one of these applications.

2. **Set Up the Project Directory**:
   - Locate the directory where your local server serves files (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs` for XAMPP on Windows or `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs` on macOS).
   - Create a new folder named `my-web-project` in the `htdocs` directory.

3. **Copy Project Files**:
   - Copy all project files (index.html, home.html, cart.php, catagories.html, images folder, and README.md) into the `my-web-project` folder.

4. **Start the Local Server**:
   - Open the control panel for your local server (e.g., XAMPP Control Panel) and start the Apache server.

5. **Access the Project**:
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost/my-web-project/index.html` to view your project. Access other HTML files by changing the URL (e.g., `http://localhost/my-web-project/home.html`).

6. **Testing PHP**:
   - To test the PHP functionality, go to `http://localhost/my-web-project/cart.php` in your browser.

By following these steps, you will be able to run the provided HTML and PHP files on your laptop.
