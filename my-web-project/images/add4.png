The file /my-web-project/my-web-project/images/add4.png is an image file. Since I cannot generate image files directly, you will need to provide an image for this file. You can either create an image named "add4.png" using an image editing tool or download an appropriate image from the internet and save it in the specified directory.

If you need help with creating or editing an image, please let me know!
